# MetaMCP

## What is MetaMCP?

MetaMCP is a unified middleware solution that manages all your Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through an intuitive graphical interface. Acting as a central hub for AI tool integrations, it provides a single point of control for multiple MCP servers while enhancing their capabilities.

- **Prompt & Resource Management**: Organize and reuse prompts and resources

## Supported Platforms

MetaMCP runs on all major operating systems:
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

## Use Cases

- **Developers**: Connect AI assistants to multiple codebases without context mixing
- **Researchers**: Maintain separate workspaces for different research domains
- **Teams**: Share configured MCP tools while keeping workspaces isolated
- **Privacy-focused users**: Self-host for complete control over your AI interactions

## Self-Hosting Benefits

Running MetaMCP through Runtipi provides:

- **Enhanced Privacy**: All data stays on your server
- **Lower Latency**: No cloud round-trips mean faster responses
