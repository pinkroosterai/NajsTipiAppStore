  "description": "MetaMCP is a unified middleware application that manages multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through an intuitive GUI interface. It acts as a central hub for all your AI tool integrations, providing workspace isolation to prevent context pollution between different projects. With MetaMCP, you can toggle tools on/off at a granular level, manage prompts and resources, and connect any MCP client like Claude Desktop or Cursor. Self-hosting with Runtipi provides enhanced privacy and reduced latency compared to cloud options.",
